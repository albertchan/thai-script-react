# learn-thai-script

I want to learn Thai because I like Thai girls.

In order to learn the Thai language better, I figured I should learn to read Thai. There are wonderful tools and apps for learning the Thai script but most of them have awful user experiences. That's why I'm making my own.

This *thing* is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

For local development, first create an environment variable file `.env.local` with the following content:

```
PROTOCOL_SCHEME=http://
VERCEL_URL=localhost:3000
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy

The project is automatically deployed to the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/). The main branch is deployed to [https://thai.hello-albert.com/](https://thai.hello-albert.com/) and non-main branches are deployed branch specific domains.
